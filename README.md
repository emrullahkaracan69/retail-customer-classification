# Retail Customer Classification & Segmentation Analysis

A comprehensive machine learning project for customer segmentation and classification using retail transaction data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project analyzes retail customer behavior through RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and implements multiple machine learning algorithms to classify customers into distinct segments.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results

- **Dataset**: 541,909 transactions â†’ 392,692 clean transactions
- **Best Model**: Gradient Boosting Classifier (87.15% accuracy)
- **Customer Segments**: 8 distinct segments identified
- **Revenue Analyzed**: Â£8.89M over 13-month period

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Insights

- Champions segment: Most valuable customers (Â£6,705 avg value)
- Lost Customers: 19.3% - retention opportunity
- UK market dominance: 82% of revenue
- Seasonality pattern with November peak
